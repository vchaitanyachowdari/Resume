## Overview

This application implements:

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities with service worker, offline support, and installability
- **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** integration with privacy-respecting analytics tracking
- **Custom event tracking** for key user interactions
- **Update notifications** for new application versions

## PWA Implementation

### Service Worker

The application uses `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox to generate a service worker with the following features:

#### Precaching Strategy

- All static assets (JS, CSS, HTML, fonts, images) are precached during service worker installation
- Assets are versioned and automatically updated when new versions are deployed
- Offline-first approach ensures the app works without network connectivity

#### Runtime Caching

The service worker implements runtime caching for:

1. **Google Fonts** - CacheFirst strategy with 1-year expiration
2. **Google Analytics** - NetworkFirst strategy with 1-day expiration
3. **Images** - CacheFirst strategy with 30-day expiration

### Manifest Configuration

The web manifest (`site.webmanifest`) includes:

- **App metadata**: Name, description, and categories
- **Icons**: 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons with both "any" and "maskable" purposes
- **Theme colors**: Supports both light (`#2563eb`) and dark (`#1e40af`) themes
- **Display mode**: Standalone for app-like experience
- **Orientation**: Portrait-primary for optimal mobile viewing

### Update Notifications

The `PWAPrompt` component provides user-friendly notifications for:

- **New Version Available**: Prompts users to refresh when updates are detected
- **Offline Ready**: Confirms when the app is available offline
- Users can choose to update immediately or continue with the current version

### Installability

The PWA meets all installability requirements:

- HTTPS deployment (required in production)
- Valid web manifest with required fields
- Service worker registered
- Icons in required sizes (192x192 and 512x512)

## Google Analytics 4 Integration

### Privacy-First Implementation

The GA4 integration respects user privacy:

1. **Do Not Track (DNT) Respect**: Analytics are disabled if the user has DNT enabled
2. **Environment-Based**: Only loads when `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` is provided
3. **Lazy Loading**: GA4 script loads asynchronously after the main application
4. **IP Anonymization**: Enabled by default
5. **Secure Cookies**: SameSite=None;Secure flags set

### Tracked Events

The following custom events are tracked:

#### 1. Resume Download
```typescript
trackDownload('V_Chaitanya_Chowdari_Resume.pdf')
```
- **Event Name**: `resume_download`
- **Parameters**: `file_name`, `event_category`
- **Trigger**: When user clicks the "Download Resume" button

#### 2. Contact Form Submission
```typescript
trackFormSubmission('contact_form', success: boolean)
```
- **Event Name**: `form_submission_success` or `form_submission_error`
- **Parameters**: `form_name`, `event_category`, `success`
- **Trigger**: When contact form is submitted
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Enabled (prevents duplicate tracking within 5 seconds)

#### 3. Theme Toggle
```typescript
trackThemeToggle('light' | 'dark')
```
- **Event Name**: `theme_toggle`
- **Parameters**: `theme`, `event_category`
- **Trigger**: When user switches between light and dark themes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Enabled

#### 4. Additional Events
- **Project Interactions**: `project_view`, `project_click`, `project_close`
- **Social Media Clicks**: `social_click`

### Duplicate Event Prevention

The analytics system prevents duplicate events using a caching mechanism:

- Events are cached with a unique key based on name and parameters
- Cached for 5 seconds to prevent accidental duplicate firing
- Can be overridden with `allowDuplicates: true` option if needed

### Development Mode

In development mode:
- All analytics events are logged to console
- GA4 initialization is logged
- Helps verify tracking is working correctly before deployment

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Google Analytics 4 (Optional - analytics disabled if not provided)
VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

#### Getting Your GA4 Measurement ID

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Create a new GA4 property (or use existing)
3. Navigate to Admin → Data Streams
4. Select your web data stream
5. Copy the "Measurement ID" (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
6. Add it to your `.env` file

### Enabling/Disabling Features

#### Disable Analytics Completely

Simply don't provide the `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` environment variable:

```bash
# .env file - leave GA4 measurement ID empty or remove it
# VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

Analytics will be automatically disabled without any code changes.

#### Disable Service Worker

To disable the service worker during development, the configuration is already set:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
devOptions: {
  enabled: false,  // Service worker disabled in dev mode
}
```

To disable in production, comment out the `VitePWA` plugin in `vite.config.ts`.

### Service Worker Update Strategy

The current configuration uses `registerType: 'prompt'`:

- Users are notified when updates are available
- Users can choose when to update
- No automatic reloads (better UX)

Alternative strategies:

```typescript
// Auto-update (reload immediately)
registerType: 'autoUpdate'

// Skip waiting (update on next page load)
registerType: 'skipWaiting'
```

## Deployment Considerations

### HTTPS Requirement

**Critical**: PWAs require HTTPS in production. Service workers will not register on HTTP.

Options:
- Use hosting platforms with built-in SSL (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages)
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) with SSL/TLS

### Build Process

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates:
- `dist/` directory with optimized assets
- `dist/sw.js` - Service worker file
- `dist/manifest.webmanifest` - Web manifest
- Precache manifest embedded in service worker

### Hosting Requirements

1. **Serve over HTTPS**
2. **Correct MIME types**:
   - `manifest.webmanifest`: `application/manifest+json`
   - `sw.js`: `application/javascript`
3. **Cache headers** for service worker:
   ```
   Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
   ```
   (Ensures users get latest service worker updates)

### CDN Configuration

If using a CDN:
- Set short cache times for `sw.js` and `manifest.webmanifest`
- Longer cache times OK for hashed assets
- Ensure CDN respects service worker cache headers

## Testing

### Testing PWA Features

#### Lighthouse Audit

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App" category
4. Run audit

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Installable
- ✅ PWA optimized
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Has a registered service worker

#### Manual Testing

**Test Installation**:
1. Open site in Chrome (desktop or mobile)
2. Look for install prompt in address bar
3. Click "Install" and verify app installs

**Test Offline**:
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
2. Check "Offline" checkbox
3. Refresh page - should still load
4. Navigate between sections - should work

**Test Updates**:
1. Deploy a new version
2. Open the app
3. Should see "Update Available" prompt
4. Click "Update" - app should refresh with new version

### Testing Analytics

#### Development Testing

Analytics events are logged to console in development:

```
[Analytics] GA4 initialized with ID: G-XXXXXXXXXX
[Analytics] Event: resume_download { file_name: "...", event_category: "engagement" }
[Analytics] Event: theme_toggle { theme: "dark", event_category: "user_preference" }
```

#### Production Testing

1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by "google-analytics" or "googletagmanager"
3. Trigger events (download resume, toggle theme, submit form)
4. Verify analytics requests are sent

#### GA4 Dashboard Verification

1. Go to Google Analytics dashboard
2. Navigate to Reports → Realtime
3. Trigger events on your site
4. Verify events appear in real-time report (may take 1-2 minutes)

### Testing Do Not Track

1. Enable DNT in browser settings:
   - Chrome: Flags or extension
   - Firefox: Preferences → Privacy → Send "Do Not Track" signal
2. Open console, should see: `[Analytics] Do Not Track enabled - analytics disabled`
3. Verify no GA requests in Network tab

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Worker Not Registering

**Symptoms**: PWA features don't work, can't install app

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure site is served over HTTPS (localhost is OK for development)
2. Check browser console for registration errors
3. Verify `sw.js` is accessible at `/sw.js`
4. Clear browser cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers

#### Analytics Not Working

**Symptoms**: Events not appearing in GA4

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` is set correctly
2. Check console for GA4 initialization message
3. Verify DNT is not enabled
4. Check Network tab for analytics requests
5. Wait 24-48 hours for data to appear in standard reports (use Realtime for immediate testing)

#### Duplicate Events

**Symptoms**: Same event tracked multiple times

**Solution**: The system has built-in duplicate prevention (5-second cache). If still occurring:
- Check if events are triggered multiple times in code
- Verify `allowDuplicates: false` is set (default)
- Check React component mounting/unmounting

#### Update Prompt Not Appearing

**Symptoms**: New versions deploy but users don't see update prompt

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `registerType: 'prompt'` in vite.config.ts
2. Check service worker is actually updating (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)
3. Ensure proper cache headers on `sw.js`
4. Try unregistering old service worker and refreshing

#### Can't Install PWA

**Symptoms**: No install prompt appears

**Solutions**:
1. Run Lighthouse PWA audit to identify issues
2. Verify manifest has all required fields
3. Check icons are accessible and correct sizes
4. Ensure service worker is registered
5. Some browsers have specific requirements (e.g., must visit site twice)

### Browser Compatibility

| Feature | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Edge |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|------|
| Service Worker | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Install Prompt | ✅ | ✅ | iOS only | ✅ |
| Background Sync | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Push Notifications | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (iOS 16.4+) | ✅ |

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for GA4:

```typescript
// main.tsx
initializeGA4({ debug: true })
```

This provides verbose logging even in production.

## Best Practices

### Analytics

1. **Be Transparent**: Inform users about data collection in privacy policy
2. **Respect Privacy**: Honor DNT and provide opt-out mechanisms
3. **Track Meaningfully**: Only track events that provide actionable insights
4. **Test Regularly**: Verify tracking is working after deployments

### PWA

1. **Test Offline**: Always test offline functionality before deploying
2. **Update Strategy**: Choose update strategy that fits your users' needs
3. **Asset Optimization**: Minimize precache size for faster installation
4. **Monitor Performance**: Use Lighthouse to track PWA score over time

### Performance

1. **Lazy Load Analytics**: Current implementation already lazy loads GA4
2. **Cache Strategically**: Different cache strategies for different asset types
3. **Minimize Precache**: Only precache essential assets
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep dependencies up to date for security and performance
