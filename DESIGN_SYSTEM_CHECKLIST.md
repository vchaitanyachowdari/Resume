  - [x] Color system documentation
  - [x] Typography guidelines
  - [x] Spacing documentation
  - [x] Component usage examples

  - [x] Typography samples
  - [x] Component showcases

### 6. Integration

- [x] Updated main.tsx to import components.css
- [x] Verified all imports work correctly
- [x] Ensured tokens are accessible throughout app
- [x] No inline styles in component patterns
- [x] All components use design tokens

### 7. Quality Checks

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Code formatted with Prettier
- [x] Build completes successfully
- [x] Dev server runs without errors
- [x] All CSS files are valid

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Testing

- [ ] Open public/styleguide.html and verify all components render correctly
- [ ] Test at 360px viewport (small mobile)
- [ ] Test at 768px viewport (tablet)
- [ ] Test at 1024px viewport (desktop)
- [ ] Test at 1440px+ viewport (ultra-wide)

### Responsive Testing

- [ ] Verify fluid typography scales smoothly
- [ ] Check grid layouts adapt at breakpoints
- [ ] Verify touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
- [ ] Test navigation behavior on mobile vs desktop
- [ ] Verify hero section layout changes appropriately

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- [ ] Test with prefers-reduced-motion enabled
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Check screen reader compatibility

### Browser Testing

- [ ] Chrome/Edge 88+
- [ ] Firefox 75+
- [ ] Safari 13.1+

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ Global tokens file exports recognizable variables used throughout CSS Modules

- tokens.css defines all design tokens as CSS custom properties
- Tokens are organized by category with clear naming
- All tokens use the `--` prefix and follow naming conventions
- Tokens are used throughout resume.css and components.css

### ✅ Layout adapts gracefully across screen sizes

- Breakpoints defined for 360px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px
- Mobile-first responsive design implemented
- Fluid typography with clamp() scales smoothly
- Grid and flex layouts adapt at each breakpoint
- Touch-friendly sizes on mobile devices

### ✅ Reusable components share consistent visual language governed by the design system

- All component patterns use design tokens exclusively
- Consistent naming with BEM methodology
- Shared base styles (buttons, cards, badges, chips, avatars)
- Layout components provide consistent spacing and structure
- No hard-coded values in component definitions

### ✅ Style guide or documentation snippet demonstrates available components/utilities

- Comprehensive STYLEGUIDE.md with examples
- Technical README.md in src/styles/
- Interactive HTML style guide (public/styleguide.html)
- Usage examples for all components
- Best practices and guidelines documented

## Notes

- All design tokens are centralized in tokens.css
- No inline styles used (except where motion libraries require)
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Accessibility features included (reduced motion, keyboard navigation)
- Component patterns follow BEM naming convention
- Utility classes provided for rapid development
- Documentation includes visual examples and code snippets

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add dark mode support with alternative color tokens
- Create additional component variants as needed
- Add animation/transition presets for common patterns
- Consider CSS Module variants for component-scoped styles
- Add RTL (right-to-left) language support if needed
